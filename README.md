## Overview of the Project
### Project: TO-Do-List App

### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a TO-Do list app so that an individual can assign their tasks and while they complete their task they can just mark their tasks as done or completed.

### Key Activities
In this project we will find that as we add the task our task is diplayed with a check box and a cross symbol.
As soon as you complete the task and check the check box your task will be terminated and then you can also remove that with the cross mark.
One of the intrested thing is that how many times you reload the page all the tasks assigne will be assigned there will be no data loss while reloading the page or if you close the application and then restart then also you won't find any changes in your tasks appearance.
